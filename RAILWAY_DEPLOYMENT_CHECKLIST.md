## 🚂 Railway Deployment

### Option 1: Auto-Deploy (Recommended)
Railway va detecta automat push-ul pe GitHub și va face redeploy.

**Steps:**
1. Push to GitHub (vezi mai sus)
2. Deschide Railway dashboard
3. Proiectul tău va începe auto-deploy
4. Așteaptă ~5-10 minute pentru build
5. Verifică logs în Railway dashboard

### Option 2: Manual Deploy
```bash
# Install Railway CLI (dacă nu e instalat)
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login
railway login

# Link project
railway link

# Deploy
railway up
```

---

## ⚙️ Environment Variables (Railway)

Asigură-te că acestea sunt setate în Railway dashboard:

### Required
```bash
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=your_chat_id
PUMPPORTAL_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

### Optional (AI Features)
```bash
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_key
GROQ_MODEL=llama-3.1-8b-instant
```

### Auto-Set by Railway
```bash
PORT=5174  # Railway va seta automat
BOT_PORT=3001
```

---

## 🔍 Post-Deploy Verification

### 1. Check Deployment Status
- Open Railway dashboard
- Verify deployment succeeded
- Check build logs (no errors)

### 2. Test Live Site
```bash
# Your Railway URL (example)
https://metapulse-production.up.railway.app
```

**Test:**
- [ ] Site loads successfully
- [ ] Dark/light mode toggle works
- [ ] API endpoints respond (/api/feed, /api/status)
- [ ] Service worker registers (F12 → Application)
- [ ] PWA install prompt appears
- [ ] Manifest.json loads (no errors)
- [ ] Icons display correctly

### 3. PWA Testing
- [ ] **Android**: Install app from Chrome
- [ ] **iOS**: Add to Home Screen from Safari
- [ ] **Desktop**: Install from browser prompt
- [ ] **Offline**: Disconnect network, app still works

### 4. Lighthouse Audit
```bash
npx lighthouse https://your-railway-url.railway.app --view
```

**Expected Scores:**
- Performance: 85-90 ✅
- Accessibility: 90-95 ✅
- Best Practices: 90-95 ✅
- SEO: 95-100 ✅
- PWA: ✅ Installable

### 5. Check Logs
```bash
# In Railway dashboard
Deployments → Your deployment → View Logs

# Look for:
✅ "Service Worker registered"
✅ "Server running on port 5174"
✅ "Bot connected"
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails on Railway
**Check:**
- Node version (>=18.0.0)
- pnpm version (>=9.0.0)
- All dependencies in package.json
- Environment variables set

**Fix:**
```bash
# In Railway dashboard
Settings → Build Command
# Should be: pnpm install && pnpm build

Settings → Start Command
# Should be: sh start-both.js or node start-both.js
```

### Service Worker Not Working
- HTTPS is required (Railway provides this automatically)
- Check manifest.json is accessible
- Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Check console for errors

### PWA Not Installable
- Verify HTTPS (Railway has this by default)
- Check manifest.json has no errors
- Verify icons are accessible
- Check service worker is activated

### API Not Responding
- Check bot service is running
- Verify environment variables
- Check logs for bot connection errors
- Verify PORT and BOT_PORT settings

---

## 📊 Performance Monitoring

### After Deploy
1. **Google Search Console**
   - Add property
   - Submit sitemap: https://your-url.railway.app/sitemap.xml
   - Monitor Core Web Vitals

2. **Vercel Analytics** (if enabled)
   - Monitor real user metrics
   - Track Core Web Vitals
   - See performance trends

3. **Railway Metrics**
   - CPU usage
   - Memory usage
   - Response times
   - Error rates
